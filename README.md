# Gamepad API Test
---

This git contains a single .html file that is meant as a test of gamepad api by coding up a small dashboard for gamepad debugging (and a test of implementing it using the webcomponents api).

If github-pages is currently working then a static version of the page is available here: https://wolly01.github.io/Gamepad-API-Test/.

Note that as currently stands any real support for pose and haptics is not implimented as I have no device that actually supports such feature-set.

I havent included any copywrite on this repo as it is just meant to be an example that is not designed to be forked for any production application.
It is more a personal proof-of-concept that may be useful to others if they are to inspect it for insights to build their own solutions, and not something ready for a production environment.
However, should one want to copy this project for their own application and need liscensing, they can contact me and I'll put one in.
